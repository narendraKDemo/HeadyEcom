# HeadyEcom
 
 This a simple demo Ecommerce app
 In this app I have used libraries like Retrofit, Dagger, DataBinding, Room.
 This project is written in Kotlin.
 As this project is small I have kept its architecture very simple but for big architecture we can easily extend this simple 
 architecture to MVVM or MVP architectures.
 As I am not UI/UX expert I have just kept simple UI that I could think of.
